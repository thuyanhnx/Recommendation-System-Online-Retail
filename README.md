# Recommendation System on Online Retail

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail

I led this project and collaborated with two other members for the Big Data course in the MS in Data Science program at the University of Michigan – Dearborn. The project applies content-based filtering, item–item collaborative filtering, and user–user collaborative filtering to generate three product recommendations for each customer on an online retail platform.
