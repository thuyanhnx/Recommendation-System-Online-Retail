Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail
This is a project associated with the course CIS 5570 - Introduction to Big Data from my MS in Data Science at University of Michigan - Dearborn. This project aims to apply content-based, item-item and user-user collaborative filtering to make 3 suggestions for each customer in an online retail platform.
