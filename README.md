# Recommendation System on Online Retail

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail

This is a group project for the course CIS 5570 – Introduction to Big Data in the MS in Data Science program at the University of Michigan – Dearborn. The project applies content-based filtering, item–item collaborative filtering, and user–user collaborative filtering to generate three product recommendations for each customer on an online retail platform.

I led the project by proposing the idea and designing the overall structure. Each recommendation system technique was assigned to a team member, and I was responsible for implementing the item–item collaborative filtering approach.
